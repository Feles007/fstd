This started with just a consolidation of things I'd have in every project like defining i32, but now I'm expanding it a bit.

Currently header only, that might change in the future.

Designed for the 99% usecase: The big 3 compilers with a modern C++ version (currently 20). There's a bit for Intel's LLVM compiler since it's basically just Clang, but I might remove that.
